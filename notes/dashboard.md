# Questions and Notes about using the Builder dashboard

- [ ] What determines the types of components that show up in the insert menu on the studio/content editing page in the dashboard?  Different components/models will have different options that users of the dashboard don't appear to have control over.

- [ ] Still having trouble rendering the header component in the content editor.  It renders perfectly on localhost.  I have worked through all of the troubleshooting options with no success.
 
I find the UI a little frustrating on the live editing, because when it's in desktop view, the right-hand side of the page is cut off.  You can scroll and see it, but for a design-focused interface, it's difficult to see the page as a whole int his mode, and I feel it impacts getting a full feel of the layout in desktop mode.  You can't resize the toolbar that appears ont he left-hand side, and I think that would make a huge difference.  

The bottom of the content is set to end right up against the bottom of the UI with no padding.  It feels abrupt.  

When you have your builder component rendered in the live editor, you will see a blue '+ Add block' button, but once you add your first builder component, the button disappears, so it's not as intuitive when you want to add more elements to the page.  It's here that you'll drag and drop, and the item will always render above the blue line that animates on the page when you drag it over.

When you are adding text to a page, you have hit the '< >' icon in the top right of the element editor pop-up to 'edit as code' in order to make changes to the font family, which is a little confusing for a product that allows "anyone" to add and edit content on a website.  

I'm also confused about the utility of the custom fields.  I added one for the display page for a greeting with default text that appears nowhere on the page.
